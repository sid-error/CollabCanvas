- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain CollabCanvas's quality.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible CollabCanvas.

1.  Fork the repo (or create a new branch if you are a collaborator) from `main`. Recommended naming: `feature/name` or `fix/issue`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### JavaScript/React Styleguide

*   Use Functional Components and Hooks.
*   Prefer `const` over `let`. Avoid `var`.
*   Use `eslint` config provided in the repository to ensure consistency.
